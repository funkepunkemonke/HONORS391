<h1>Programming in R</h1>

<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>Welcome to Programming in R! My name is Amanda Suzzi and I'll be lead you on this adventure. I am excited to have you in my class this semester and look forward to embarking on a journey together as we learn data manipulation, data visualization, creating dynamic document, and developing shiny web applications. </p>

<p>Hands-on computer exercises based on a wide range of materials are utilized to provide a solid foundation for further R programming classes. </p>

<h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>My teaching is hands-on, and to follow these lessons, you must have R and RStudio installed on their computers. You also need to be able to install a number of R packages, create directories, and download files.</p>
<p>To avoid troubleshooting during the lessons, You should follow the instruction below to download and install (or update) everything beforehand. </p>

<h3>Install R and RStudio</h3>
<p>R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>R</strong> is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis</li>
<li><strong>RStudio</strong> is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. In this course we use RStudio to interact with R.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't already have R and RStudio installed, follow the instructions for your operating system below. You have to install R before you install RStudio.</p>

<h4>Windows</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download R from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">CRAN website</a>.</li>
<li>Run the <code>.exe</code> file that was just downloaded</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio download page</a></li>
<li>Under <em>Installers</em> select <strong>RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows Vista/7/8/10</strong> (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)</li>
<li>Double click the file to install it</li>
<li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.</li>
</ul>

<h5>MacOS</h5>
<ul>
<li>Download R from the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">CRAN website</a>.</li>
<li>Select the <code>.pkg</code> file for the latest R version</li>
<li>Double click on the downloaded file to install R</li>
<li>It is also a good idea to install <a href="https://www.xquartz.org/">XQuartz</a> (needed by some packages)</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio download page</a></li>
<li>Under <em>Installers</em> select <strong>RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)</strong> (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)</li>
<li>Double click the file to install RStudio</li>
<li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h5>Linux</h5>
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions for your distribution from <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux">CRAN</a>, they provide information to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run <code>sudo apt-get install r-base</code>, and for Fedora <code>sudo yum install R</code>), but we don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio download page</a></li>
<li>Under <em>Installers</em> select the version that matches your distribution, and install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu <code>sudo dpkg -i   rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb</code> at the terminal).</li>
<li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Update R and RStudio</h3>
<p>If you already have R and RStudio installed, check if your R and RStudio are up to date:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you open RStudio your R version will be printed in the console on the bottom left. Alternatively, you can type <code>sessionInfo()</code> into the console. If your R version is 4.0.0 or later, you don't need to update R for this lesson. If your version of R is older than that, download and install the latest version of R from the R project website <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">for Windows</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">for MacOS</a>, or <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/">for Linux</a></li>
<li>To update RStudio to the latest version, open RStudio and click on <code>Help&quot; &gt; Check for updates</code>. If a new version is available, quit RStudio, follow the instruction on screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: It is not necessary to remove old versions of R from your system, but if you wish to do so you can <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f">check here.</a></p>


<h3>Install required R package</h3>
<p>During the course we will need a number of R packages. Packages contain useful R code written by other people. We will use the package <code>tidyverse</code>.</p>
<p>To try to install this package, open RStudio and copy and paste the following command into the console window (look for a blinking cursor on the bottom left), then press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows and Linux) or <kbd>Return</kbd> (MacOS) to execute the command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">install.package(&quot;tidyverse&quot;</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, you can install the packages using RStudio's graphical user interface by going to <code>Tools &gt; Install Packages</code> and typing the names of the packages separated by a comma.</p>
<p>R tries to download and install the packages on your machine. When the installation has finished, you can try to load the packages by pasting the following code into the console:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(tidyverse)</code></pre></div>
<p>If you do not see an error, you are good to go!</p>
